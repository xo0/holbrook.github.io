Wish list

Replace libpurple with telepathy (pretty please?). 
Investigating adding telepathy support. ETA not-very-soon, busy with many things.
Make an ELPA package for it. (An ELPA package doesn’t really make sense since ELIM is a C program. Distributing the elisp portion by itself is not that helpful. --technomancy)
Notify the user when a new message is received.
DONE
Tab-completion for nicks (in IRC and MUCs). An IRC client can’t be without that!
